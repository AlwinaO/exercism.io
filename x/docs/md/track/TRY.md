### Try It!

If you've downloaded the [command-line client](/clients/cli) and have LANGUAGE installed
on your machine, then go ahead and fetch the first problem.

```plain
exercism fetch TRACK_ID
```

In order to be able to submit your solution, you'll need to configure the client with your
[Exercism API key](/account/key).

```plain
exercism configure --key=YOUR_EXERCISM_KEY
```

When you've written a solution, submit it to the site.
The solution is a source file, in wich you have written your code
to pass the test suite of a given problem, so the command to submit it will look like this:

```plain
exercism submit PATH_TO_YOUR_SOURCE_FILE
```

If you have splitted your solution in several files or have used additional configuration files, submit them too.

It is fine to submit incomplete solutions. If you are struggling with a problem, submit the solution you currently
have and then explore other solutions or ask for help from other students in the comments. When you understood the
problem, rewrite your solution and submit it second time.
