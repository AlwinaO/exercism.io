### Try It!

If you've downloaded the [command-line client](/clients/cli) and have LANGUAGE installed
on your machine, then go ahead and fetch the first problem.

```plain
exercism fetch TRACK_ID
```

In order to be able to submit your solution, you'll need to configure the client with your
[Exercism API key](/account/key).

```plain
exercism configure --key=YOUR_EXERCISM_KEY
```

When you've written a solution, a source file to pass the test suite of a problem, submit it to the site.
You'll have to configure the command-line client with your exercism API key before you can submit.

Submit the solution with the following command:

```plain
exercism submit PATH_TO_YOUR_SOURCE_FILE
```

If you split your solution into several files or have used additional configuration files, submit them too.

### Are you stuck trying to solve an exercise?
Submit the unfinished solution and describe in a comment on the website what you tried, and where
you're stuck. Or jump into the [support chat](https://gitter.im/exercism/support), and we'll try to help you out.
When you understood the problem, rewrite your solution and submit it second time.
